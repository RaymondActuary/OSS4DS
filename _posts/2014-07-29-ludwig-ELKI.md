ELKI (or Environment for DeveLoping KDD-Applications Supported by Index-Structures) is a knowledge discovery in databases (KDD, "data mining") software framework developed for use in research and teaching by the database systems research unit of Professor Hans-Peter Kriegel at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany. 
It aims at allowing the development and evaluation of advanced data mining algorithms and their interaction with database index structures.

__Features:__

* The focus of ELKI is research in algorithms, with an emphasis on unsupervised methods in cluster analysis and outlier detection.
 
* In order to achieve high performance and scalability, ELKI offers many data index structures such as the R*-tree that can provide major performance gains. 

* ELKI is designed to be easy to extend for researchers and students in this domain, and welcomes contributions in particular of new methods. 

* ELKI aims at providing a large collection of highly parameterizable algorithms, in order to allow easy and fair evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms.
