Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for Java created by the [Machine Learning Group at the University of Waikato](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/). Started in 1993 as a mixture of TCL/TK, C, and Makefiles, Weka was redeveloped from scratch in Java in 1997.

__Features:__

* Contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization
* Provides multiple graphical user interfaces to access the underlying functionality more easily
* Recent versions include new packages for distributed data mining: distributedWekaBase, which provides base "map" and "reduce" tasks, and distributedWekaHadoop, with Hadoop-specific wrappers
