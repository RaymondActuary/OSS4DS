The SciPy library (not to be confused with the related [SciPy software ecosystem](http://www.scipy.org/)) is a package of algorithms and functions core to Python's scientific computing capabilities. In 2001, a number of modules for scientific and technical computing were merged to become SciPy, providing a standard collection of numerical operations atop the Numeric array data structure.
