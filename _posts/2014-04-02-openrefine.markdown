OpenRefine is an application for [data wrangling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling), data cleanup, and data transformation between different formats. Originally created by MetaWeb as "Freebase Gridworks," it was subsequently acquired by Google, renamed Google Refine, and ultimately transitioned to the open source community as OpenRefine.
