Originally created in 1988 by [John W. Eaton](http://jbrwww.che.wisc.edu/home/jwe/), GNU Octave is designed to be a mostly-compatible open source alternative to [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). It's a high-level programming language primarily intended for numerical computations, and it provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization.
